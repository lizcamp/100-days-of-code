# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Github Learning Lab tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Git is not very intuitive, but I know it's a crucial skill to learn.


### Day 2: February 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the https://learngitbranching.js.org/ tutorial.

**Thoughts**: Very tricky! Not as easy to walk through as the Learning Lab. 


### Day 3: February 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Paired with Vincent to work on the Guitar App.

**Thoughts** It's great to work with an experienced dev. Learned a lot. 


### Day 3: February 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Working on my FCC tribute page. Also set up this repo.

**Thoughts** Not very confident I did the repo right. Also wish I hadn't put off this Tribute page project for so long & just moved on to the other lessons like I did. Better late than never!
